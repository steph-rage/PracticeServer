# Practice Server 

This collection of programs was written in order to learn the basics of creating a web server in Python. 


## Getting Started

There are a few different servers, written with different levels of dependencies. 

### Prerequisites

Download the requirements.txt file and run

		pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running

After installing the program, you can run any of the .py files using Python 3. 

Both server_example and server_input_example are built using the http.server library in Python. The first uses GET data to add two numbers together, and the second uses POST data to update the visable page. 

The socket_server is just the example from the Python socket documentation, written to better understand how a socket server works.
